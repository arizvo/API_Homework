SMOKE TEST

Smoke test consists of following steps:
  - get token (login)
  - successfull booking
  - successfull booking update
  - list all bookings by ID
  - find booking by ID
  - delete booking by ID

- For several recived error messages, I found that displayed text is not properly describing actual state of the respond. According to that I suggested appropriate messages in comments.

Task 2
